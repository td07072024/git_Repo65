Both Indian and Greco-Roman traditions characterise the dynasty's founder as of low birth.[6] According to Greek historian Diodorus (1st century BCE), Porus told Alexander that the contemporary Nanda king was thought to be the son of a barber.[7] Roman historian Curtius (1st century CE) adds that according to Porus, this barber became the former queen's paramour thanks to his attractive looks, treacherously assassinated the then king, usurped the supreme authority by pretending to act as a guardian for the then princes, and later killed the princes.[7][8]

The Jain tradition, as recorded in the Avashyaka Sutra and the 12th-century text Parishishta-parvan, corroborates the Greco-Roman accounts, stating that the first Nanda king was the son of a barber. [9][1][10] According to the 12th century text Parishishta-parvan, the mother of the first Nanda king was a courtesan. However, the text also states that the daughter of the last Nanda king married Chandragupta, because it was customary for Kshatriya girls to choose their husbands; thus, it implies that the Nanda king claimed to be a Kshatriya, that is, a member of the warrior class.[9]

The Puranas name the dynasty's founder as Mahapadma, and claim that he was the son of the Shaishunaga king Mahanandin. However, even these texts hint at the low birth of the Nandas, when they state that Mahapadma's mother belonged to the Shudra class, the lowest of the varnas.[10][11]

Since the claim of the barber ancestry of the dynasty's founder is attested by two different traditionsâ€”Greco-Roman and Jain, it appears to be more reliable than the Puranic claim of Shaishunaga ancestry.[12]

The Buddhist tradition calls the Nandas "of unknown lineage" (annata-kula). According to Mahavamsa, the dynasty's founder was Ugrasena, who was originally "a man of the frontier": he fell into the hands of a gang of robbers, and later became their leader.[13] He later ousted the sons of the Shaishunaga king Kalashoka (or Kakavarna).[8]

K. N. Panikkar suggested that the Nandas were the sole Kshatriyas in India "at the time of the Mauryas" and M. N. Srinivas suggested that the "other Kshatriya castes have come into existence through a process of caste mobility from among the lower castes".
